Sharpness (Laplacian Variance):

lap_var = cv2.Laplacian(img, cv2.CV_64F).var()
What it measures: Edge clarity. High sharpness means edges in the image are well-defined.

How it works: The Laplacian filter highlights edges. The variance of the result tells us how much edge detail there is.

Typical Ranges:

0–50: Very blurry

50–100: Slightly blurry

100–500: Acceptable to sharp

500+: Very sharp (may be noisy too)

Threshold: Often set at 100 to differentiate blurry from sharp.

2. Brightness (Mean Pixel Intensity)

brightness = np.mean(img)
What it measures: Average grayscale intensity of the image.

Range: 0 (completely black) to 255 (completely white)

Typical Ranges:

0–50: Very dark

50–100: Low brightness

100–180: Normal

180–255: Very bright

Threshold for "good" brightness: ~100 to 180


3. Contrast (Standard Deviation of Intensity)

contrast = np.std(img)
What it measures: The spread between dark and light areas. High contrast means strong difference between light/dark.

Range: 0 (all pixels same value) to ~127 (maximum spread)

Typical Ranges:

0–20: Very low contrast (flat image)

20–50: Moderate contrast

50–100+: High contrast (punchy image)	



Implementing  Image Quality Analysis:
Sharpness: Use algorithms like the variance of the Laplacian to assess image sharpness.

Brightness: Calculate the mean pixel intensity to evaluate brightness levels.

Contrast: Determine the standard deviation of pixel intensities to measure contrast.

Threshold: Often, 30–60 is a healthy range for general contrast.
